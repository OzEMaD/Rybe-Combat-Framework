# Rybe's Combat Framework
> A classic version of [ACF](https://github.com/ACF-Team/ACF-3) for those who miss that classic feel!

Rybe's Combat Framework (RCF) is an unofficial and possibly buggy fork of [ACF](https://github.com/ACF-Team/ACF-3)

## Installation

### Dependencies
    ACF Requires these to work

Wiremod ([Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=160250458) or [Github](https://github.com/wiremod))

Prop Protection with [CPPI](http://ulyssesmod.net/archive/CPPI_v1-3.pdf) is not required, but highly recommended. We'd recommend Nadmod PP ([Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3492696307) or [github](https://git.groovyexpress.com/edshot99/NadmodPP)
ACF works best when used with thin plate models and SProps ([Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=173482196)) provides a more complete selection over the vanilla PHX plates.

### Git Client (Recommended)

Install a Git client, such as the [Github client](https://desktop.github.com/) or [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), then clone RCF to your addons folder. With the Github client installed you can click the green button at the top of the RCF repo page and select clone. Updating RCF on your server or client after install simply requires clicking the pull button in your respective Git client.

### Manually

1. Click the green button at the top of the RCF repo and select zip.
2. Extract the RCF folder.
3. Inside you will find another RCF folder.
4. Move the inner RCF folder to `garrysmod/garrysmod/addons`
